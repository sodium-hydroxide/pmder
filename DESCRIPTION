Author: Noah J. Blair and Alexander Brandl

Description: pmder contains data and functions for computing the absolute efficiency of a polyvinyl-toluene plastic scintillator modeled using MCNP. The predicted efficiencies are given as a function of the source energy (keV), truck position (cm), and truck contents (foodstuff or metal). There are capabilities of determining the absolute efficiency based on the original model, and creating a new method given intrinsic efficiency data for the detector.
